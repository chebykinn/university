# NASA's R&D

The argumentation is flawed because those who in favour of NASA's R&D bringing
huge returns just assume that NASA R&D is the same as commercial R&D.
The only article that tried to actually quantify economic benefits
of NASA's R&D came to a conclusion that only 10th part of investments was returned.

# Product recall

Our company announces the recall of the Primaro Hybrid due to a potential
problem in a brake system. There is a slight possibility, that in some cases
of slippery road the driver can briefly encounter a slight delay after pressing
brake pedal.

The problem may arise, in very rare instances when brake controller switches
to ABS braking on slippery road, however in all cases brakes are powerful
enough to perform completely safe stop.

Even though the delay itself is not dangerous, at our company,
we care about providing our customers the best driving experience they can get,
so we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers.

We advise all owners of Primaro Hybrid to contact their local dealer,
who will carry out a free inspection of their vehicle, which will only take up
to ten minutes to complete.
